# CECS550 LinUCB Dynamic Alpha

The traditional LinUCB Disjoint algorithm is a contextual bandit algorithm commonly used in recommender systems. Our project implements the traditional LinUCB Disjoint algorithm with tunable alpha parameters to simulate LinUCB policies, evaluate their performance, and visualize the results.
